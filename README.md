# ‚ùÑÔ∏è Norway Snowfall Prediction using LSTM.

This project predicts upcoming snowfall in different regions of Norway using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory),
a powerful deep learning model for time series forecasting.
The dataset includes historical snowfall data, temperature, humidity, and other weather variables.
